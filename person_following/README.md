# Person Following

Our team programmed the AV to follow a selected person. We use an object tracker from dlib and have PID tuning classes for the steering angle and speed of the vehicle. To calculate steering angle, we use horizontal deviation of the bounding box from center. To calculate speed, we use the height of the bounding box. We can even switch to reverse gear when the object starts walking towards the vehicle.
